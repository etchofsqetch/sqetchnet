Configuration files juste pour voir..

These files need to be stored in your home folder and renamed to start with a dot so they show up as system configuration files.

Home folder is ~

files will look like:


~/.vimrc
~/.zshrc

Don't forget to source the configuration file for the shell you are using in ~/.profile
ie: source ~/.bashrc

Happy Hacking!
